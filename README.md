## UX
### High level considerations
-	Looking at the target audience: This is a very culturally appropriate project. It is a web app that focuses on sharing recipes. 
-	Anybody can use this web app. The content will focus on recipes and food. 
-	Can we track and catalogue the content in an intuitive way? 
-	The content will be entered into a database and be displayed to the different pages
-	Cook books require people to buy the books while this web app provides the recipes for free
-	The technology we are using is very modern: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Python and MongoDB

### Business goals 

Due to the assessment, business goals are negligible. 

### Strategy Trade Off 


-	I am making a Web app that allows people to find and share recipes  
-	The value we provide is to be able to quickly find recipes and share them. 
-	Anyone is allowed to use the website
-	People looking for recipes are people we do not know what to make for breakfast/dinner/lunch so we aim to provide as many recipes for these as possible. 
-	Competitors normally share their recipes in a blog which makes it tedious because as a user, we do not care about the bloggerâ€™s life story regarding that recipe, we just want the recipe. 
-	Competitors who share their recipes on non-blog sites normally share gifs of their recipe on forums (Reddit) but without knowing that you can control the gif makes it long to find the next step because you will have to wait for the gif to replay before you can see the next step. 
-	User needs: 
o	Easily find and share recipes 
-	Site owners goal:
o	Promote cooking equipment (AMC Classic (?))
-	Will need to include instructions on site

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

1. Testing if Project deploys successfully to Heroku: (Sha: 937c8b93b29328c060febef617a9b8f7421e3a7d)
    - after the [Deployment](#deployment) sequence I pushed my work to GitHub
    - I got a jinja error
    - I revisited my app.py file and saw I rendered the wrong template which does not exists
    - To fix this I renamed the template the to correct corresponding template which does exists (sha: 079dc6719fb3d9ca5ac7e4859456d2a042d8becd)
    - app now successfully launches to Heroku. 

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

Link to the live page: https://keis5ingredientsfoods.herokuapp.com/ 

To deploy this project I followed the following steps:
1. I created my env.py file where I created my variables (IP, Port, MONGo_URI, MONGO_DBNAME and a secret key for flashed massages)
2. I used the CLI to install all my frameworks and collected them inside the requirements.txt file (See requirements.txt)
3. I created my procfile for heroku stating that it should run app.py as a web app and it uses the python language
4. I created my MongoDB and connected to it
5. I went to https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps and created my new app
6. I connected to my GitHub repository via Heroku
7. I then went to setting and added my configuartion variables (same variables as in my env.py file)
8. I connected to my master branch and this is the final step of deployment 

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
